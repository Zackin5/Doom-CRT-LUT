# Doom-CRT-LUT
Custom LUT WAD for GZDoom emulating the incorrect white balence look of CRT photos (specificly those found [here](https://www.retrogameboards.com/t/what-does-the-original-doom-look-like-in-native-res-on-a-pc-crt/1883/3))

Uses [EXL's LUT shader implementation](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/105492-color-grading-in-gzdoom/) as a base
